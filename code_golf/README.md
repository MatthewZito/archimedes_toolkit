## What is Code Golf?

"Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that implements a certain algorithm."<sup>1</sup>

Code Golf (alternately, 'golf scripting') has expanded its purview to include obscure code, esoteric solutions, and extreme performance optimizations. And it's a hobby of mine.
