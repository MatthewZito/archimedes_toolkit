# utils
various custom utilities 

This directory contains several custom utilities spanning myriad domains, among them scripting, validation, general I/O applications, and web plugins.
These utilities are first built in a generalized, 'boilerplate' manner; they are each later expounded upon, in some cases to such a degree that
I have published them (e.g. the [pynotes command-line utility](https://github.com/MatthewZito/py_notes), or the [putlocker userscript](https://github.com/MatthewZito/utils/blob/master/web/putlockerstyle.js))

They may be of use to you. Otherwise, I store these scripts here so as to facilitate the aggregation thereof into a scalable, portable library of personal computing utilities.
