# The following script automates the process and works across all Linux distros
# because it has no dependencies on specialized packages. It simply parses the
# output of the ip command, isolates the vendor part of mac address into a variable
# which is finally grep'ed through an online DB of vendor prefixes.

# With a bit of creativity you could adapt this to execute remotely via ssh.
# I've seen other suggestions to identify vendor details using dmidecode for OS 
# fingerprinting, but experienced inconsistent results with that tool when testing.
